<p>This is a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.</p>

<p>"The double-fisting variation of the RPS game is an interesting one on one multiple-match mode. The players are arranged in a circle. Each player will play against the players on his right and on his left with the use of both hands. Any player who loses to the throws on both sides is eliminated from the circle of play. This continues until only two players are left. Then a regular RPS match(es) will be played by the surviving two players to declare who is victorious and who loses. A Double Fisting RPS match usually requires a referee who will monitor the game and prevent any form of cheating. This is because it has been discovered to be very easy for a player to falsify his throws or leverage the carelessness or split the attention of another player. Your game is going to have 3 players. One is going to be the program user and the other 2 has to be simulated by as automatic players with random moves. Even in the event that the player loses in the first part, you should allow the 2 computer simulated players to play the final round."</p>
